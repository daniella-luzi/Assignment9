BubbleSort and MergeSort are very similar.
They both sort numbers in an array from smallest to largest.
They both used the methods: createRandomArray, writeArrayToFile, and readArrayToFile.
I didn't have to change my code inside those methods, which was really helpful and convienent.
I included a printArray method for mergeSort, and used the same code in the bubbleSort method.
In order to implement the choice of either BubbleSort or MergeSort I included if statements.
BubbleSort has 1 bubbleSort method.
MergeSort has a mergeSort method, and a merge method in order to complete the sort.
